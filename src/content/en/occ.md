# OCC Mundial — Backend Developer
**July 2022 — July 2025**

**Summary**
Actively participated in the migration and integration of a unified platform. Focused on backend services, performance, observability and CI/CD to ensure reliable delivery and scalability.

**Key achievements**
- Participated in integrating a unified platform written in C#, consolidating endpoints for mobile and web consumption.
